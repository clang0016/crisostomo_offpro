(ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) 0:00
(ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)0:06

(ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) 0:09
(ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) 0:14

I was listenin' to the ocean 0:17
I saw a face in the sand 0:21

But when I picked it up 0:24
Then it vanished away from my hands, dah 0:26

I had a dream, I was seven 0:33
Climbin' my way in a tree 0:37

I saw a piece of Heaven 0:41
Waitin' in patience for me, dah 0:44

And I was runnin' far away 0:50
Would I run off the world someday? 0:52

Nobody knows, nobody knows 0:55
And I was dancing in the rain 0:58

I felt alive and I can't complain 1:00
But no, take me home 1:03

Take me home where I belong 1:05
I can't take it anymore 1:09

I was painting a picture 1:16
The picture was a painting of you 1:19

And for a moment I thought you were here 1:22
But then again, it wasn't true, dah 1:26

And all this time I have been lyin' 1:32
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself 1:35

I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf 1:39
La-di-da 1:45

And I was runnin' far away 1:48
Would I run off the world someday? 1:51

Nobody knows, nobody knows 1:53
And I was dancing in the rain 1:57

I felt alive and I can't complain 1:59
But no, take me home 2:01

Take me home where I belong 2:03
I got no other place to go 2:07

No, take me home 2:10
Take me home where I belong 2:12

I got no other place to go 2:15
No, take me home 2:18

Take me home where I belong 2:20
I can't take it anymore 2:24

But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall 2:29-2:33
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall 2:38-2:41

And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall 2:46-2:49
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall 2:55-2:58

And I was runnin' far away 3:03
Would I run off the world someday? 3:06

But no, take me home 3:08
Take me home where I belong 3:10

I got no other place to go 3:14
Take me home where I belong 3:17

I got no other place to go 3:22
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no 3:25-3:28

No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh 3:33-3:36
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no 3:42-3:44

No, take me home, home where I belong 3:50
I can't take it anymore 3:56
